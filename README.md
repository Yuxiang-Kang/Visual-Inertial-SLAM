# Visual-Inertial-SLAM
A Visual-Inertial SLAM system in Python. Extended Kalman filter is implemented. Course project of UCSD ECE276.
The SLAM system involves an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a stereo camera. The sensors are attached to a moving vehicle and collected data in the process. To decrease the error caused by noise in SLAM, extended Kalman filter (EKF) was applied to correct the vehicleâ€™s trajectory based on visual features detected in camera data.
